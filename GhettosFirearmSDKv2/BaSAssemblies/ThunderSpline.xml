        <member name="P:ThunderRoad.Splines.ThunderSpline.KnotLinkCollection">
            <summary>
            A collection of all linked knots. Linked knots can be on different splines. However, knots can
            only link to other knots within the same container. This collection is used to maintain
            the validity of the links when operations such as knot insertions or removals are performed on the splines.
